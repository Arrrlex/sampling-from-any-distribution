# Sampling from Any Distribution

This is the companion codebase to my blog posts [Sampling from Any Distribution](https://alexmck.com/posts/sampling-from-any-distribution/) and [Sampling from Any Distribution, Part 2](https://alexmck.com/posts/sampling-from-any-distribution-2/).

To run, you'll need to install a few libraries, but I'm afraid I haven't kept track of which ones, so good luck I suppose :)
