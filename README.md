# Sampling from Any Distribution

This is the companion codebase to my blog posts [Sampling from Any Distribution](https://alexmck.com/posts/sampling-from-any-distribution/) and [Sampling from Any Distribution, Part 2](https://alexmck.com/posts/sampling-from-any-distribution-2/).

To run, I'd recommend installing [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) and running the code using `uv run python ...`.
